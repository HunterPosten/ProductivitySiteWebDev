	<h1>A little bit about this site</h1>

	<img src="Hunter.jpg" id="hunter" alt="pic of me">
	<p> This site was designed by me, Hunter Posten. I am currently 22 years old, and a senior 
		CISC Major at the University of St. Thomas. Besides
		making amazing websites and getting A's in web development classes I also like to go hiking, hammocking, check out local events, and biking. I'm originally from Andover, Minnesota and had a great time growing up there. In the future I hope to get a career doing something in software development, either that or I'll just be homeless and live under a bridge.

	<h2> How I made this site:</h2>

	<p> In the process of making this site I had to use many tools. the base structure of each page is coded in HTML this allowed me to construct and modify each page structurally without worrying about how the styling would be affected. When I did want to concern myself with styling I would modify the site wide CSS file. having each page in the site use the same css file allows this site to have a cohesive look. Finally since there are a few elements on my site that are interactive i needed to include some javascript. I wrote all of this using Sublime text and tested each page on Opera and Chrome. Overall this project has definitely forced me to learn a lot about css and javascript since i only new the bare bones basics before.</p>
